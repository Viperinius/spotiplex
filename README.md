# spotiplex
Converts a Spotify playlist to one on your Plex server

If you want to use this little thingy, take a look into `main.py`. It shows how to get from the Spotify playlist to a Plex playlist using the included methods.
Be aware that `main.py` lacks a small part of the workflow that you have to add yourself: Getting the tracks and adding them to your Plex server. This is described in `main.py` as well, just go through the comments and you will find the mentioned part of the sequence.
